# HeyClicky 1.1.1 → OpenClicky feature ledger — 24 October 2026

Every HeyClicky for Windows 1.1.1 feature we could find, what OpenClicky has today, and how each one gets reverse-engineered, rebuilt and checked. Clean-room: this ledger and the inventories describe behaviour in our own words. OpenClicky never copies HeyClicky code, prompt text, art, sounds, fonts or wording, and never calls HeyClicky's backend, its Supabase project, or Stripe.

Sources (all in [`docs/research/heyclicky-1.1.1/`](../research/heyclicky-1.1.1/)):

Status: **Have** = OpenClicky already does it · **Partial** · **Missing** · **Skip** = deliberately not reproduced · **Extra** = OpenClicky-only, kept.
RE depth: **S** = static evidence is enough · **L** = needs a live view-only look at HeyClicky for look/timing · **B** = behaviour needs a hands-on trial in HeyClicky by the user.

## 1. Shell and look (sub-project A)

| ID | Feature | HeyClicky behaviour (summary) | OpenClicky today | RE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Notch | Dark pill top-centre; hover/activation expands a tabbed peek (Home · Chat · Settings · transient Document); follows the display under the cursor; never takes focus; files can be dropped on it | Missing (normal Home window + round dock) | L |
| A2 | Home tab | Time-of-day greeting with name; hold-keys hint; jobs working/need-you line; featured job result card; connected-apps pill; (referral pill = Skip) | Missing | S+L |
| A3 | Chat tab | History rows (text, hand-off, drawing, action captions, date separators), composer with attachments/drop/paste, talk button, earlier/newest controls, full-reply view, read-aloud switch, empty/error states | Partial (Chat tab + React chat) | S+L |
| A4 | Document tab | Viewer for Markdown, spreadsheet (sum/avg/count), PDF first pages, text; open in app / show in Explorer / close | Missing | S |
| A5 | Notch cards | ~20 transient cards under the notch: activity strip, text input/response with auto-dismiss, job update/needs-you, muted speaker, mic trouble, dictation clipboard, dictionary learned, document access, app updated, tips | Missing (balloon tips) | S |
| A6 | Agents dock | Paper-note job cards fanned at the right screen edge / carousel either side of the notch; states Queued/Working/NeedsYou/Done/Failed/Stopped/New; plan checklist, live line, progress, file chips, ready-output button, footer requests, "+N more" | Missing (Work tab lists) | S+L |
| A7 | Visual system | Dark near-black panels, rounded cards, white pill secondary / blue gradient primary buttons, green status badges, small-caps section headers; paper/ink job cards; accent = cursor colour (blue #3380FF default, red, yellow, green); spring motion with reduced-motion fallback; follows Windows light/dark | Missing (light green WinForms theme) | L |
| A8 | Tray menu | Open Settings · Pause/Resume · Report a bug · Request a feature · What's new · Check for updates · Quit | Partial (different items) | S |
| A9 | General behaviour | Show in taskbar; show in screen recordings (capture exclusion); launch at login; pause (ignore shortcuts) | Missing | S |
| A10 | Updates | Hourly check, "Install & Relaunch", install on quit, "What's new" | Missing | S |
| A11 | Onboarding | Intro (welcome, colour pick), permission cards (mic, screen), hands-on tour (mic check, voice hello, draw demo, circle-to-ask, drive demo, text mode, dictation, finale) | Built (sub-project H, 25 Oct). A 12-step tour card sits under the notch on first run and is replayed from Settings → General. Every step can be skipped, and nothing runs until you click. The permission cards explain what leaves the PC and open `ms-settings:` pages; they change nothing. The draw demo is an offline canned reply. The drive demo is the offline sandbox practice run, always Confirm-each with the C12 consent card, and the access setting is never touched. Native check pending the user's list below. Evidence: `OnboardingFlowTests`, `OnboardingContractTests`, `OnboardingDrawDemoTests`; vitest `onboarding/Onboarding.test.tsx` and `settings.test.tsx`; render check of the dev shell page (commits 5bc3abd..508bd43) | S+L |
| A11-S1 | Onboarding extras | Discovery-source chips, skill selection, squad packs, hatch flight, intro video, tour music | Skip: marketing/telemetry, or art and sound we would invent wholesale; the spec's intro is welcome + colour | — |
| A11-S2 | Onboarding sign-in, speaker check, interview, email draft, paywall | Sign-in step, "set volume to 50%", interview that builds personal agents, email-draft step, onboarding paywall | Skip. Sign-in stays in Settings → Account and is never automated; voice hello links there. The volume change would alter a Windows setting for the user. The interview, email draft and paywall are not in the spec. | — |
| A11-S3 | Tour navigation | Clickable progress dots, resume mid-tour after a restart | Skip: the dots show progress only; a tour quit half-way starts again next launch (Skip is one click) | — |
| A12 | Accounts/plans/paywall/referral/telemetry | Google sign-in via Supabase, Stripe plans, usage leases, Invite & Earn, PostHog, Sentry | Skip — OpenClicky keeps ChatGPT sign-in, no billing, no telemetry | — |

**A11 native acceptance: pending.** A11 moves to Native-accepted after the user runs these checks. They need a real microphone, voice, hotkeys and the drive confirmations:

1. With a fresh settings folder, or after Settings → General → Start tour, the tour card appears under the notch. Skip tour hides it, and it does not come back on restart.
2. The colour pick changes the companion cursor colour at once.
3. The microphone card's button opens Windows' microphone page. After toggling desktop-app access there, Check again updates the line.
4. Mic check: Test microphone moves the bars and ticks "I can hear you."
5. Voice hello: hold Ctrl+Alt and say your name. The status cycles and the reply is spoken, and the step ticks (also with conversation history off).
6. Draw demo: Show me draws a circle, an arrow and a note, and Esc wipes them.
7. Circle-to-ask: hold the talk keys, circle something and ask; the answer is about it.
8. Drive demo with Settings → Access set to Auto: the consent card appears, then a confirm for every step in the test window, and afterwards Access is still Auto. Skip during the run stops it.
9. Text mode: double-tap Ctrl opens the text box and the step ticks.
10. Dictation: in Notepad, hold Ctrl+Win and speak. The text appears and the step ticks.
11. Finale: Show me Home opens Home.
12. On a 1366×768 laptop, or a 1080p screen at 125%, Start tour from Settings → General closes Settings and shows the card in full.

## 3. Dictation (sub-project D)

| ID | Feature | HeyClicky behaviour | OpenClicky today | RE |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Hold/hands-free dictation | Hold Ctrl+Win, release inserts at caret; double-tap for hands-free | Built — hold and double-tap hands-free with Stop and activity card; native check pending the user's list below. Evidence: `DictationGateTests`, `DictationCardsTests`, `DictationFlowTests`; SecretStore.Smoke `--automatic-dictation`, `--dictation-ui-state` (commits 2d9dc1e..3463e6b) | S |
| D2 | Context + cleanup | Reads focused field over UIA (app, site, nearby text) to clean up the transcript | Built — field context read over UIA (≤2,000 chars before/after/selected, passwords and own windows never read) and AI tidy-up with a result guard and 6 s timeout; native check pending. Evidence: `DictationFieldContextTests`, `DictationCleanupTests`, `DictationTextFitTests`; Agent.Smoke `--dictation` (`dictation_context`, `dictation_flow`) | S |
| D3 | Insertion | Paste + verify + clipboard restore; per-app strategies; refuses passwords/address bars; clipboard fallback card | Built — keeps the verified Unicode `SendInput` + UIA read-back, refuses passwords; a failed or unverifiable insert goes to the clipboard with a card; native check pending. Evidence: `DictationFlowTests`; Agent.Smoke `--dictation` fixture check (real control read back as `Say: Hello, world.`; real clipboard read back, user's clipboard restored) | S |
| D4 | Dictionary | ≤50 custom words; learns single-word corrections after insertion; "added to dictionary" card | Built — ≤50 words of ≤60 characters in the Whisper prompt and tidy-up; single-word corrections learned with an Undo card; native check pending. Evidence: `DictationCorrectionDetectorTests`, `LevenshteinTests`, `WhisperPromptTests`, `SettingsCatalogTests` | S |
| D5 | Languages | ~50 languages + auto-detect | Built — 50 language codes plus auto-detect and an optional multilingual Whisper model (size and SHA-256 verified, downloaded only on click); native check pending. Evidence: `WhisperModelChoiceTests`, `SettingsPatchTests`, vitest `voicePages.test.tsx` | S |
| D-S1 | Paste-based insertion (clipboard snapshot/restore) and blind paste for apps without UIA | Pastes with Ctrl+V and restores the clipboard; pastes blind where UIA gives nothing | Skip — we keep the verified insertion, which never touches the clipboard and can be checked; fields it cannot insert into get the clipboard card (D3) instead of an unverified blind paste | — |
| D-S2 | Terminal-specific insertion | Per-terminal strategies | Skip — terminals expose no writable `ValuePattern`, so they take the clipboard path; revisit if users ask | — |
| D-S3 | Streaming (cloud) STT, warm sockets, batch upload | Cloud speech-to-text | Skip — dictation stays on local Whisper; speech never leaves the PC | — |
| D-S4 | 14-day local transcript archive | Keeps dictated transcripts for 14 days | Skip — not in the spec; it would keep a store of everything dictated; add only if a history UI is asked for | — |
| D-S5 | Word limits / paywall | Weekly word cap tied to plans | Skip — OpenClicky has no plans or limits | — |
| D-S6 | Seeding the account name and per-session context keyterms into the vocabulary | Adds the signed-in name and session terms to the vocabulary | Skip — the dictionary covers names the user cares about, and field context already reaches the tidy-up | — |

**Native-accepted: pending.** D1–D5 move to Native-accepted after the user runs these seven checks (they need a real voice and keyboard):

1. Hold Ctrl+Win in Notepad and say "um so the meeting is on Tuesday". Release: "So the meeting is on Tuesday." is typed at the caret (tidy-up on).
2. Double-tap Ctrl+Win, say two sentences with a pause, then double-tap again: both are typed, and the notch shows "Hands-free dictation" with Stop.
3. While holding Ctrl+Win, press another key (for example Ctrl+Win+D): dictation cancels and nothing is typed.
4. Dictate with the desktop focused: the clipboard card appears, and Ctrl+V in Notepad pastes the words.
5. Dictate a name Whisper gets wrong, fix that one word by hand: "New dictionary word" appears; Undo removes it from Settings → Dictation.
6. Download the multilingual voice, pick Spanish (or leave auto-detect on) and dictate a Spanish sentence.
7. Dictate into a password box: refused, nothing is typed or copied.

## 6. OpenClicky extras kept (Extra)

Clipboard shelf · local Whisper and Windows voice (offline) · Preview / Confirm-each / Auto / Full access modes with deny list and physical-takeover pause · local notes · memory panel · interactive visuals (chart, diagram, calculator, 3D) · Tasks timeline with AG-UI export · awareness offers · OpenRouter option · sandbox demos. Each moves into the new shell (Settings sections or Chat/Home entries) rather than being removed.

## 7. Per-feature reverse-engineering and build loop

For every ledger row, in sub-project order:

1. **Understand** — re-read the row's inventory evidence. If RE = L, do a view-only look at the running HeyClicky (screenshots, no setting changes). If RE = B, ask the user to perform the action in HeyClicky and watch it.
2. **Specify** — write the behaviour in our own words (inputs, states, timings, edge cases) into the sub-project spec. No HeyClicky method bodies are decompiled; metadata, constants, strings and observed behaviour only.
3. **Build** — implement in OpenClicky following its existing patterns and safety rules.
4. **Test** — unit tests for logic (state machines, schedules, parsers, policies); native checks in the running app (inspect the real destination, not logs); side-by-side screenshot against HeyClicky for UI rows.
5. **Record** — mark the row Built → Native-accepted in this ledger and in `docs/feature-plan.md`.
